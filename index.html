                    from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                    100% recommend! ”
